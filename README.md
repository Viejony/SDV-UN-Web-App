# SDV-UN-Web-App

This web application makes the use of the SDV (LabFabEx in National University of Colombia) simpler, through a user interface based on a map and navigation buttons.

SDV-UN-Web-App in Vanilla Branch not uses PHP and not requires XAMPP. This implementation only needs that you configure an IP direction for your SDV.
